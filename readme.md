## Excel Fuel server (typescript)

This is an express.js server for Excel Fuel _(project)_ build in `Typescript` with `Nodemon`, including full rest/api with authentication and route separations: `/api`,`/app`

Features:

    - Express.js
    - Separation of concerns
    - Typescript with models
    - Production ready
    - Linted
    - Rest/api
    - Api Authentication

### Install

Application is fixed to `node@12.0.0` and `npm@6.9.0`, so install `nvm` manager when required.

-   Required global installations: `nodemon`,`typescript (tsc)`, and `esm`

```sh
$/ npm install
```

### Start / build / production

Server starts on port `5000`

-   production ready files are build at` /dist`

```sh
$/ npm run dev:start # development with nodenom
$/ npm run prod:start # build and run in production
$/ npm run build # only build new production files inside /dist
```

### Config

Config settings can be found at `/src/config.ts`

-   includes our user credentials (for demo), and session secret

### Running fullstack application

1. Generate new client build _(follow excel-fuel-app-client readme.md instructions)_
2. Add new build to /views, with the same application name: `/views/excel-fuel`
3. Run fullstack app in development or production modes at `localhost:5000/app`

#### Live Demo

Hosted on heroku node.js server (_server has timeout limit_, free dyno):

```
access:
https://pacific-meadow-55275.herokuapp.com/app
```

#### heroku

You will find a separate file for heroku if providing production only version, so need to rename `package.heroku.json` to `package.json` and follow heroku process instructions.

#### Client app repo

Excel fuel angular app can be found at:

```sh
/$ git clone https://github.com/eag1ex/excel-fuel-app-client
```

#### Developer Notes

-   Wasn't entirely sure of logic for products/points (ExcelProductPoint[]) and how they should behave so implemented my own take on it:)
-   I have included my last production build at /dist _(for heroku production only deployment)_
-   Dont run http://localhost:5000/api/ and http://localhost:5000/app/ in the same browser, angular manifest and ngsw-worker hijacks requests

#### TESTS

-   No tests available for this projects, except for 1 test to deploy to heroku

#### Thank you
